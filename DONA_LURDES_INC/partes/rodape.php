        The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men <br/>
        Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness <br/>
        For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children <br/>
        And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them
